# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge we were asked to refactor the provided code. We were expected to use Semantic HTML elements, the image elements needed alt information added, the title needed to be descriptive, not just "website". The CSS file also needed to be commented, and be organized so that it followed the HTML structure.
